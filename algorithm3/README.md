This procedue implements the algorithm 3 presented in the paper. For each folder named by a cipher name contains two files:
* [cipher.py] --- This code defines a class for each cipher, and the class has two methods, of which one is to generate the MILP model given the corresponding arguments, the other one is to solve the model to search integral distinguishers. 
* [main.py] --- This is main procedure.
